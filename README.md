# Server Hardening

### Minimal hardening for proxy server

Just run this command and enter the inputs 

```bash
sudo bash hardening.sh
```

The script is waiting for you to copy your `public ssh key` to your new user's home directory that was created recently.

**Note:** `UFW` will be enabled after the script is run, and the ssh port will be changed to `8452`, also you can't login into ssh through [password](https://github.com/mehrdad-drpc/serverharden/blob/edc3601d1befeb838a87acca3e3294eac1698990/sshd_config#L9) due to new ssh config.

### Follow the below command to copy your `public key`

```bash
$ ssh-copy-id -p <default_port_number> -i /path/to/<your_public_key> <new_user>@<server_address>
```

### Test your connection

```bash
$ ssh <your_server_ip_address> -p 8452 -l <new_user>
```
